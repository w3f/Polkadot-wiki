## Polkadot Wallets

The integration of a [wallet](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary#wallet) with Polkadot
allows for simple and easy access to private keys and signing transactions. Below are some wallets
that support Polkadot along with their development statuses.

Note that inclusion does not necessarily imply endorsement of that wallet. Polkadot support can
provide assistance with issues related to Polkadot-JS, the Polkadot{.js} extension, or Parity
Signer. For other wallet software, you should contact the developers of that wallet.

## Encryption Enhancement

Some recently generated `JSON` account files cannot be imported (restored) into older wallet
software. This is due to an enhanced encryption method, which is also noticeable in a slight delay
when encrypting/decrypting your wallet. If you are unable to load a `JSON` file, please ensure that
you are using the latest version of the wallet software. If you are still unable to load it, ensure
that the wallet software is using the latest version of the
[Polkadot API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/).

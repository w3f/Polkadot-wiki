Balance transfers are used to send one balance from one account to another account. To start
transferring balances, we will begin by using the Polkadot-JS User Interface.

## Polkadot-JS UI

Begin by opening up the [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). There are two ways to make a
transaction: underneath "Accounts" by using the "Transfer" tab or through the "Accounts" tab. We
will be starting off with the Accounts tab, so head there.

> Please note: For these examples, the network of choice is Polkadot. If you'd like to change this,
> please click on the network selection from the top left corner of the navigation.

Assuming that you've already [created a Polkadot or Kusama account](learn-account-generation), we
will click on the "send" button beside the account you'd like to send from.

There should be a window that pops up displaying the sender, the receiver, the amount, and the
existential deposit (minimum amount you must have in your account balance).

If you wanted to send a transfer using the "Transfer" tab underneath "Accounts", you'd need to head
over to the specific tab and the window will ask you for the same information as before.

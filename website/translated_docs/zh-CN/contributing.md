The wiki was started and is maintained by Web3 Foundation. It is an Open-ish open source project and aims to be the most extensive resource of knowledge on Polkadot and the Polkadot ecosystem. A large part of the material currently focuses on Polkadot directly but it is not opposed to cover informational material for community projects. But please do not try to pull request any marketing material as this will be rejected.

Pull requests, discussions and contributions from the community are encouraged. For certain active community members who demonstrate a record of good contributions, they may be given write access to the repository. Otherwise, Web3 Foundation holds the administrative position and final say on the content that is included. Specifically the Technical Education team at the foundation are most directly involved.

## 如何参与贡献

使用 GitHub 帐户，可以轻松地为 Wiki 作出贡献。每个页面都是 markdown 文件，是[非常容易学习](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 纯文本的语法扩展，使创建链接，渲染图像和美观的格式变得简单。

Each page has an "Edit" button on the top right of the content. By clicking this button you are taken to the GitHub sign in page, where you can either login or create an account.

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the GitHub text editor in which you can make your edits directly. When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed and commit to a new branch to create a new Pull Request to the repository. From there one of the maintainers will either merge it in or request changes very soon.

When Polkadot enters into its soft launch, the functionality for making on-chain claims for DOTs
will already be enabled. If you've made a pre-genesis claim by sending a claim transaction to the
Claims Contract on Ethereum, then you should already know your Polkadot address. You will still need
to send a free transaction that will agree to the terms and conditions of your allocation. You must
either _claim_ or _attest_ before your DOTs are available in your account.

This guide will walk you through the steps for either making a claim or attesting to the statement.

If you are making a claim on Polkadot for the first time please read on below in the
[making a claim](#making-a-claim) section. If you've already claimed during the pre-genesis claims
please proceed to [attesting to a statement](#attesting-to-a-statement) section instead.

## Making a Claim

If you did not make a claim in the pre-genesis claims period then you are able to make a claim any
time after genesis. There is no time limit for making your claim so feel free to do this whenever
you are most comfortable.

> Note: When you make a claim, at the same time you will make an attestation to the required
> statement. The two actions "claim" and "attest" are done at once in a `claim_attest` transaction,
> but for the most part this is simplified from the perspective of the UI.

### What You Will Need

- The Ethereum account that holds the DOT indicator tokens
- The MyCrypto wallet
- A Polkadot account

You should already have your Ethereum account that holds the DOT indicator tokens from Polkadot's
prior sales. You will need to have access to this account in order to make a signature.

[MyCrypto][] is a versatile wallet that supports a variety of storage methods for your Ethereum
account. Please click on the link to go to their downloads page and ensure you download the latest
version for your operating system. This is important because the latest version will always have the
latest security patches.

> **NOTICE**: It is much more secure to download and use the MyCrypto app locally. You can always
> find the most up-to-date releases of the desktop app on their [releases page][mycrypto].

You will need a Polkadot account to be the destination of the DOTs that will be sent to you after
you claim. Please follow the instructions on the [account generation][] page for generating a new
Polkadot account.

#### Claiming your DOT with MyCrypto

The Polkadot JS [Claims app][] helps you sign a message from MyCrypto. MyCrypto is a good choice in
case you have stored the key to the Ethereum account holding your DOT indicator tokens on a hardware
device like a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor. It also supports raw private keys, mnemonics and Parity
signer.

Once you've downloaded MyCrypto and have it running locally (we recommend an air-gapped computer for
maximum security), you can start by navigating to the Claims app on Polkadot-JS Apps. Select the
account you would like to claim the DOTs into and click the blue "Continue" button to proceed. Your
screen should look something like this:

![claim-1](assets/new-claims/claim-1.png)

Now you will need to provide the Ethereum address that is associated with the DOT indicator tokens
that you will claim. Enter the Ethereum address into the box and click "Continue". Next your screen
should look the image below.

![claim-2](assets/new-claims/new-claim-2.png)

The hex encoded string that follows the sentence: "Pay DOTs to the Polkadot account:" is the
hex-encoded public key of your Polkadot account, minus the `0x` prefix.

The next step is to go to the MyCrypto application and click on "Sign & Verify Message" tab.

![claim-3](assets/new-claims/claim-3.png)

This will prompt you to select a method for unlocking your wallet.

![claim-3](assets/new-claims/claim-4.png)

After unlocking your wallet, paste the message from Polkadot JS into the "Message" box.

![claim-5](assets/new-claims/new-claim-5.png)

When you click "Sign Message" you will get a JSON output like the below:

![claim-6](assets/new-claims/new-claim-6.png)

Copy and paste the JSON output of the signed message from MyCrypto into the input box on the
Polkadot JS UI and click "Confirm Claim."

![claim-7](assets/new-claims/new-claim-7.png)

Now a green box will appear telling you the amount to claim with a "Claim" button to make the claim.
Click on the "Claim" button and click "Submit (no signature)" to complete the claim.

![claim-9](assets/new-claims/claim-9.png)

At this point you will see a success message if everything went right and your DOTs will now be in
the account that you claimed to.

![claim-10](assets/new-claims/claim-10.png)

Congratulations, you have now completed the process for claiming and signing for your DOTs.

#### Verifying your Claim

After you make an on-chain claim for DOTs, your balance should be updated on the Polkadot UI
immediately.

### Third Party Claims Processes

#### Coinbase Custody

> Please note that using Coinbase Custody for the claims process requires your account to contain at
> least 1,000 DOTs. There are also fees associated with Coinbase Custody. If you have fewer than
> this number, please use a different way of generating a Polkadot address.

1. To open an account please contact Coinbase Custody directly at sales@coinbase.com
1. Once youâ€™ve opened an account, Coinbase Custody will generate a DOT address for you to use in the
   claims process and send it to you.
1. You may then claim your tokens using your Coinbase Custody DOT address and your tokens will
   appear in your Coinbase Custody account.

For questions about claiming with Coinbase Custody, please contact: Nick de Bontin +1-630-884-8182
sales@coinbase.com.

#### Other Third Party Processes

**We do not recommend using other third-party apps or processes to perform your claim or acquire
DOT.**

Claiming using other third-party processes can lead to the loss of your allocation, therefore we
cannot recommend using any third party apps to do so. Manually specifying your transaction data, as
specified in our claims process, or by using Coinbase Custody, is the only way to be certain you
will receive your allocation.

## Attesting to a Statement

If you've already made a pre-genesis claim, you still have to agree to a statement using your
Polkadot account.

### What you will need

- Your Polkadot account unlocked on Polkadot-JS Apps UI.

You will be sending a free transaction from your Polkadot account on the Polkadot-JS Apps UI. Once
you make this transaction you will have the tokens available in your account to use for staking,
voting, and eventually transfers.

### Log on to Polkadot-JS Apps

Proceed to [polkadot-js Apps][claims app]. You will need to grant Apps access to your account in
some way. One way would be to go to the Accounts page and "create" a new account, replacing the
generated seed or mnemonic with the one belonging to your account. The other way is by using the
Polkadot-JS extension and entering your seed or mnemonic there, which is generally safer than
entering it directly to the Apps page.

### Make the attestation

Once you have your account entered you should see a red counter appear on the "Claim Tokens" tab on
the left navigation drawer.

![claim-attest-1](assets/new-claims/new-attest-1.png)

Click on the "Claim Tokens" tab and you will see a large notification at the top of the page that
tells you that you need to sign an attestation.

![claim-attest-2](assets/new-claims/new-attest-2.png)

The notification will display one or more polkadot addresses that you have loaded in apps that needs
to sign. You will select the Polkadot account that needs to sign by using the selector on the page.
If you don't see a notification or don't see the selector, please double check the account has been
loaded into Polkadot-JS and that it has already claimed during the preclaim period.

Click "Continue" and you will see a green box appear to the right of the selector.

![claim-attest-3](assets/new-claims/new-attest-3.png)

![claim-attest-4](assets/new-claims/new-attest-4.png)

Click on "Attest" and then "Sign and Submit" to make your free attest transaction. When the
transaction is included in the block, you will see a green success box appear in the upper left
corner and the DOTs will be in your account.

作为我们在Web3基金会中的目标之一，我们正在推动 [Web3技术栈](http://wiki.web3.foundation/en/latest/tech_stack/tech_stack_overview/)，我们想支持任何个人或团队组织黑客活动，让更多的开发者了解你的城市的波尔卡多特/Substal。

我们不仅为您提供技术资源，而且还可以安排我们团队的人来做具体的技术工作坊和讲解介绍我们的技术，从而帮助参与者可以更快地开启hack开发工作。

## How do hackathons differ from workshops?
Hackathon is aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and demonstrate their ideas to reality in a short period (few hours - one day). Workshops are more for getting developers familiar with the tooling and understanding more about what are the resources currently available and how they can make use of it.

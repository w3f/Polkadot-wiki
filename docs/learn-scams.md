Scams have unfortunately made an impact on our community. It's important to stay alert and protect
yourself and your non-refundable crypto assets from scammers. If you ever feel you are being
scammed, please email [our support team](mailto:support@web3.foundation).

### Types of Scams

- Personal messages over Telegram, Twitter, and other social media
- 'Send us DOT/KSM, we'll send you double'
- Emails asking for DOT/KSM private keys/seeds/etc., posing as a member of our team
- Scammers will take official videos, add text to it so that it looks like an official video
- Many scammers will create nearly perfect imitations of sites - triple-check the URL
- People offering to help you stake or get rewards
- People answering questions you asked publicly in a private chat
- Scammers will often make it seem like the 'deal' is only available for a limited time. Do not be
  tricked by this, it is always better to confirm than to risk losing everything.

### Admin will never contact you over Telegram, nor any other Social Media

If you've received a message from an admin over Telegram, ignore it. Our Polkadot team will never
personally message you. Our social media's are posted on our website and any new social media's will
be announced by our team. We will never offer to sell you DOTs at a discount, air-drop "rewards", or
message you privately to help with a problem you posted publicly.

### Always check the source

For any potential scam, always be sure to do a background check on the source, i.e, look at any
username, email, Youtube channel name, URL, etc. If something seems fishy, that's because it likely
is. Never enter any personal data after clicking on a link, always type it in yourself. Feel free to
check with support@polkadot.network.

### Check twice before sending DOT/KSM

A good practice to take in consideration is to verify the address you are sending crypto to. If you
don't know that account, you probably shouldn't be sending your assets there. It's your
responsibility to make sure that you understand where you are sending your funds to, crypto is a
decentralized space and your only recourse if a mistake is made is by appealing to the council (who
usually will not get involved in matters of mistaken transfers).

### Keep your personal data secure

One should _never_, share their secret key with anyone, nor any other personal data that is
associated with you. It's recommended to store your information safe on paper or on a hardware
wallet. Never enter your seed or mnemonic phrase on a website.

### Essential rules:

1. Never, ever, ever share your seed phrase or account password
2. Do not trust anyone online. It is trivial for them to lie, change identities.
3. If you are scammed, there is likely nothing that can be done to recover your funds. If a scammer
   gets a hold of your seed phrase, they can transfer all of your funds to their account in seconds.
   It is better to be safe than to risk all of DOT and KSM.
4. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. People, especially celebrities, do not give
   away crypto for free. Even if they wanted to, they could just ask for your address as opposed to
   having you send them tokens.
5. Scams are absolutely rife in this space. It is easy and cheap to set a scam up, and hard to shut
   one down. Therefore, the onus is on the user to be as diligent as possible in avoiding them.

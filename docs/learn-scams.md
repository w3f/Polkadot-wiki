Scams have unfortunately made an impact on our community. It's important to stay alert and protect
yourself and your non-refundable crypto assets from scammers. If you ever feel you are being
scammed, please email [our support team](mailto:support@web3.foundation).

### Types of Scams

- Personal messages over Telegram, and other social medias
- 'Send us DOT/KSM, we'll send you double'
- Emails asking for DOT/KSM addresses, posing as a member of our team

### Admins will never contact you over Telegram, Twitter, etc.

If you've received a message from an admin over Telegram, ignore it. Our Polkadot team will never
personally message you first. Our social media's are posted on our website and any new social media's will
be announced by our team.

### Always check the source

For any potential scam, always be sure to do a background check on the source, i.e, look at any
username, email, Youtube channel name, etc. If something seems fishy, that's because it likely is.

### Check twice before sending DOT/KSM

A good practice to take in consideration is to verify the address you are sending crypto to. If you
don't know that account, you probably shouldn't be sending your assets there. It's your responsibility to make sure that you understand where you are sending your funds to, crypto is a decentralized space and your only recourse if a mistake is made is by appealing to the council (who usually will not get involved in matters of mistaken transfers).

### Keep your personal data secure

One should _never_, share their secret key, seed, mnemonic phrase, etc. with anyone, nor any other personal data that is
associated with you. It's recommended to store your information safe on paper or on a hardware
wallet.

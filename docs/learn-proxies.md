Polkadot provides a module that allows users to set proxy accounts to perform a limited number of
actions on their behalf. Much like the Stash and Controller account relationship in
[staking](learn-staking), proxies allow users to keep one account in cold storage and actively
participate in the network with the weight of the tokens in that account.

## Proxy Types

You can set a proxy account via the Proxy module. When you set a proxy, you must choose a type of
proxy for the relationship. Polkadot offers:

- Any
- Non-transfer
- Governance
- Staking
- Identity Judgement

When a proxy account makes a `proxy` transaction, Polkadot filters the desired transaction to ensure
that the proxy account has the appropriate permission to make that transaction on behalf of the cold
account.

### Any Proxies

As implied by the name, a proxy type of "Any" allows the proxy account to make any transaction,
incuding balance transfers. In most cases, this should be avoided as the proxy account is used more
frequently than the cold account and is therefore less secure.

### Non-transfer Proxies

Proxies that are of the type "non-transfer" are accounts that allow any type of transaction except
balance transfers (including vested transfers).

### Governance Proxies

The "Governance" type will allow proxies to make transactions related to governance (i.e., from the
Democracy, Council, Treasury, Technical Committee, and Elections pallets).

### Staking Proxies

The "Staking" type allows staking-related transactions, but do not confuse a staking proxy with the
Controller account. Within the Staking pallet, some transactions must come from the Stash, while
others must come from the Controller. The Stash account is meant to stay in cold storage, while the
Controller account makes day-to-day transactions like setting session keys or deciding which
validators to nominate. The Stash account still needs to make some transactions, though, like
bonding extra funds or designating a new Controller. A proxy doesn't change the _roles_ of Stash and
Controller accounts, but does allow the Stash to be accessed even less frequently.

### Identity Judgement Proxies

"Identity Judgement" proxies are in charge of allowing registars to make judgement on an account's
identity. If you are unfamiliar with judgements and identities on chain, please refer to
[this page](learn-identity#judgements).

### Anonymous Proxies

Polkadot includes a function to create an anonymous proxy, an account that can only be accessed via
proxy. That is, it generates an address but no corresponding private key. Normally, a primary
account designates a proxy account, but anonymous proxies are the opposite. The account that creates
the proxy relationship is the proxy account and the new account is the primary. Use extreme care
with anonymous proxies; once you remove the proxy relationship, the account will be inaccessible.

## Why use a Proxy?

Proxies are great to use for specific purposes because they add in a layer of security. Rather than
using funds in one sole account, smaller accounts with unique roles complete tasks for the main
stash account. This drives attention away from the main account and to proxies.

Anonymous proxies, in particular, can be used for permissionless management. In this example below,
there is a multisig with four different accounts inside. Two of the accounts, Alice and Bob, have an
anonymous proxy attached to them. In the case that the multisig account wanted to add or remove Alice or Bob
or even add in a new account into the anonymous proxy, the anonymous proxy would take care of that
change. If a multisig wanted to modify itself without an anonymous proxy, a whole new multisig would
be created.

## How to set up a Proxy

### Using the Polkadot-JS UI

To set up a proxy, navigate to the
[Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) and click on "Developer" >
"Extrinsics". Here we will see a page that looks similar to this:

![proxy generation](assets/polkadot_generating_proxy.png)

Now, to add a proxy, we must first click on the selection of pallets, the button will be "submit the
following extrinsic". Select the "proxy" pallet to load in all the functions that come with it. The
`addProxy(proxy, proxy_type)` function will need to be selected in order to add in a proxy. The
chosen proxy account that you set will be the account that has the proxy on it. The selected account
at the top is the account that will be the user primary account or stash account.

> Note! If you see an "unused" option when adding in a proxy, this is not a proxy type. This is an
> empty enum, and if you try to add this in as a proxy, nothing will happen. No new proxy will be
> created.

### Creating Anonymous Proxies on Polkadot-JS UI

For anonymous proxies, a different function will need to be called, the
`anonymous(proxy_type, index)`. This will let you customize what kind of anonymous proxy you'd like
to set up if you choose, as well as the index.

### Another way to create Proxies

There is also another other way you can set up a proxy on Polkadot-JS UI. Head over to "Accounts" in
the navigation and then click the "Accounts" button. For each of the accounts you have on this
page, the three dot button will let you create a proxy by using "Add proxy". This will open up a pop
up onto your screen where you will be able to select the type of proxy for that specific account.

> Note: You cannot create an anonymous function from the Accounts page, you must be on the
> Extrinsics page.

### Removing Proxies

If you want to remove a proxy, there are a few functions on the extrinsic page that will help do
this. The `killAnonymous()` function will let you remove an anonymous proxy. Both the
`removeProxies()` and the `removeProxy()` will remove any other type of proxy but one function will
remove all proxies made while the other will remove one proxy, respectively.

## Putting It All Together

If the idea of proxy types and their application seems abstract, it is. Here is an example of how
you might use these accounts. Imagine you have one account as your primary token-holding account,
and don't want to access it very often, but you do want to participate in governance and staking.
You could set Governance and Staking proxies.

![proxies](assets/regular_proxy_diagram.png)

In this example, the primary account A would only make two transactions to set account B as its
governance proxy and account C as its staking proxy. Now, account B could participate in governance
activity on behalf of A.

Likewise, account C could perform actions typically associated with a stash account, like bonding
funds and setting a Controller, in this case account D. Actions that normally require the Stash,
like bonding extra tokens or setting a new Controller, can all be handled by its proxy account C. In
the case that account C is compromised, it doesn't have access to transfer-related transactions, so
the primary account could just set a new proxy to replace it.

By creating multiple accounts that act for a single account, it lets you come up with more granular
security practices around how you protect private keys while still being able to actively
participate in a network.

Welcome to the builders section of the Polkadot wiki.

Here you will be able to find the most up-to-date information on the status of the development 
tools in the Polkadot ecosystem. We are always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about 
them so if you are working on something that should be included please reach out to us on
[Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org).

This section of the wiki is divided into the following parts:

## Development Guide

- [Starter's Guide](build-build-with-polkadot) - High level overview on choosing a parachain, 
parathread, or smart contract for your project and how to get started.
- [Development Roadmap](build-dev-roadmap) - Tracker for the development state of the most 
important tools.
- [Parachain Development Kits](build-pdk) - PDKs are toolkits for building parachains and 
parathreads.
- [Smart Contracts](build-smart-contracts) - Smart contracts are fragments of custom logic that can 
be deployed to a live chain.

## Integration Guide

This section is for service providers like wallets or validator operators who want to learn how to 
integrate Polkadot into their systems.

- [Polkadot Protocol Information](learn-protocol-info) - General information and F.A.Q.s about the 
Polkadot protocol, e.g. _how does replay protection work?_
- [Node Management](learn-node-management) - A short overview of the Parity Polkadot client and the 
most relevant options/flags for infrastructure providers.
- [Node Interaction](learn-node-interaction) - Learn how to interact with your node via RPC.
- [Transation Construction and Signing](learn-transaction-construction) - Learn the transaction 
format for Polkadot and how to construct and sign transactions offline.

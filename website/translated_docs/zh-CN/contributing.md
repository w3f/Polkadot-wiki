The wiki was started and is maintained by the Web3 Foundation. It is an Open-ish open source project and aims to be the most extensive resource of knowledge on Polkadot and the Polkadot ecosystem. A large part of the material currently focuses on Polkadot directly but it is not opposed to cover informational material for community projects. But please do not try to pull request any marketing material as this will be rejected.

Pull requests, discussions and contributions from the community are encouraged. For certain active community members who demonstrate a record of good contributions, they may be given write access to the repository. Otherwise, the Web3 Foundation holds the administrative position and final say on the content that is included. Specifically the Technical Education team at the foundation are most directly involved.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to the wiki is easy with a GitHub account. Every page is a markdown file, which is a [very easy to learn](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax extension to plain text that makes creating links, rendering images, and nice-looking formatting simple.

Each page has an "Edit" button on the top right of the content. By clicking this button you are taken to the GitHub text editor in which you can make your edits directly. When you've completed your changes you can create a new Pull Request to the repository and one of the maintainers will either merge it in or request changes very soon.

## 规则

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **没有` --force ` pushes **或以任何方式修改 Git 历史记录。
2. 对于某些问题，尤其是对于诸如错别字之类的较小更改，优先使用 Pull requests。 问题适用于一般或广泛的更改或内容缺少。
3. **非主要分支**应用于正在进行的工作。
4. **重大修改**应该用** pull request**的约束，以征询其他贡献者的反馈。
5. 对于任何其不是非常重要的贡献，_鼓励_ Pull requests，但由贡献者自行决定。
6. 贡献者应尝试遵循 Markdown 样式，语言和布局。
7. 应使用正确的语法。带有错别字的 Pull requests 的请求在修复之前不会合并。
8. 应注意保持尽可能客观和有益的信息。不应故意编造 ，也不应存在外部偏见。

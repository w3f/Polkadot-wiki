## 什么是 DOTs？

DOT 是 Polkadot 网络的原生代币，类似于 BTC 是比特币的原生代币或以太币是以太坊区块链的原生代币。

Kusama tokens (KSM) and DOT tokens both have 12 decimal places, with the smallest unit being the Planck (a reference to [Planck Length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length), the smallest possible distance in the physical Universe). You can compare the Planck to satoshis or wei, while the DOT is like a bitcoin or an ether.

**Polkadot**
| Unit | Decimal Places |
| ---- | -------------- |
|      |                |
 Planck| 1 Point | 3 Microdot (uDOT)| 6 Millidot (mDOT)| 9 Dot (DOT) | 12

## DOTs 用途是什么？

DOTs serve three key functions in Polkadot, (i) to be used for governance of the network, (ii) to be staked for operation of the network, and (iii) to be bonded to connect a chain to Polkadot as a parachain.

DOTs can also serve ancillary functions by virtue of being a transferrable token. For example, DOTs stored in the Treasury can be sent to teams working on relevant projects for the Polkadot network.

### DOTs 用于治理

The first function of DOTs is to entitle holders to control of the governance of the platform. Some functions which are included under the governance mechanism include determining the fees of the network, the addition or removal of parachains, and exceptional events such as upgrades and fixes to the Polkadot platform.

Polkadot will enable any holder of DOTs to participate in governance. For details on how holders can participate in governance, as well as their rights and responsibilities, see the [governance page](learn-governance).

### DOTs 用于共识

DOTs will be used to facilitate the consensus mechanism that underpins Polkadot. In order for the platform to function and allow for valid transactions to be carried out across parachains, Polkadot will rely on holders of DOTs to play active roles. Participants will put their DOTs at risk (via staking) to perform these functions. The staking of DOTs acts as a disincentive for malicious participants whom will be punished by the network by getting their DOTs slashed. The DOTs required to participate in the network will vary depending on the activity which is being performed, the duration the DOTs will be staked for, and the total number of DOTs staked.

### DOTs 用于绑定

DOTs will have the ability to be bonded for a duration of time in order to add a new parachain to the network. The DOTs will be locked during their bonding period and will be released back to the account that bonded them after the duration of the bond has elapsed and the parachain is removed.

## 主网 DOTs

Web3 Foundation will distribute up to 20% of mainnet DOTs prior to network launch in early 2020 (see the [Light Paper](https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf) or the [Polkadot Network FAQ](https://polkadot.network/faq/)). As Gavin Wood, one of the project's founders, said in his year-end recap, there may be a generally available public sale for some portion of that amount at some point this year. Subscribe to the Polkadot newsletter on [polkadot.network](https://polkadot.network/) for further updates.

_Warning: Mainnet DOT tokens are not transferrable until mainnet launch, expected in early 2020. Therefore any transfers of Mainnet DOTs are illegitimate and unauthorized. DOTs can not be moved from a current allocation address. Individuals with an allocation of DOTs who transfer their DOT address to someone else can always keep a copy of their private key, therefore there is extreme risk for individuals participating in transfers of DOTs before mainnet launch._

Testnet dots are freely available now - see below for various ways to obtain them.

## 测试网 DOTs

DOTs are required to make transactions on the Polkadot network. Testnet DOTs do not have any value beside allowing you to experiment with the network.

### 获取测试网 DOTs

You can request DOTs from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.network/), the [BlockX Labs faucet](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com/) or ask someone to send you DOTs on the [Polkadot Watercooler](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org).

Also, you can get DOTs by joining the [faucet channel](https://matrix.to/#/!puxkyylfiAUGGBhGmY:web3.foundation?via=web3.foundation&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.parity.io) on Riot. Simply input `!faucet` to know how to use it.


You can make your own DOTs by [becoming a validator](https://wiki.polkadot.network/en/latest/polkadot/node/guides/how-to-validate/).

## Kusama 代币

Unlike testnet DOTs, Kusama tokens are not freely given away. Kusama tokens are available via the [claims process](https://claim.kusama.network/) (if you have already purchased DOTs), the [frictional faucet](https://guide.kusama.network/en/latest/start/faucet/), or via [grant request](http://grants.web3.foundation) from the Web3 Foundation.
